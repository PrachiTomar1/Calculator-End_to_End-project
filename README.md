# Notes:
# Backend API:
1. Save the backend logic in calculator_backend.py.
2. Save the API code in calculator_api.py.
3. Install Flask using pip install Flask.
4. Run calculator_api.py using the command python calculator_api.py. This will start a local server.

# Frontend UI:
1. Save the frontend UI code in calculator_ui.py.
2. Install requests library using pip install requests.
3. Run calculator_ui.py using the command python calculator_ui.py.

# How it Works:
1. The UI takes two numbers as input and provides buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. When a button is clicked, the UI sends a request to the backend Flask API to perform the selected operation.
3. The backend API performs the calculation and returns the result, which is then displayed in the UI.
